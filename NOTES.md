## Previous Positioning: Hospitality & Property Management

The site originally targeted hospitality and property management businesses in San Diego. This positioning was shelved in Feb 2026 in favor of a general AI agent building consultancy, but may be revisited.

### Saved messaging and content:

- **Hero badge:** "AI Agents for Hospitality & Property Management"
- **Hero headline:** "Stop Losing Revenue to Slow Response Times"
- **Hero subtext:** "Your guests message at 2am. Tenants submit requests that get buried in group chats. Your team answers the same 20 questions, 200 times a week. We build AI agents that handle it — autonomously."
- **Key stats:**
  - 73% of hotel guests expect a response within 5 minutes
  - 60% reduction in front-desk call volume with AI guest communication
- **Scenario:** 2:17 AM — A Guest Reports a Broken AC (comparison of with/without AI agent handling a hotel maintenance request)
- **Industries section:** Two cards with Unsplash background images:
  - Hospitality: guest communication, booking management, operations coordination
  - Property Management: maintenance workflows, tenant communication, document processing
- **Differentiator #3:** "Built for Your Industry" — deep focus on hospitality and property management workflows
- **Founding Partner Program:** "Selecting 3 San Diego hospitality and property management businesses"
- **Founder bio:** "saw hospitality and property management businesses drowning in repetitive operational work"
